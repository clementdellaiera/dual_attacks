\maketitle
Critics of the dual attack have focused their arguments on the following points :
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] The independence of the summands in the distiguisher.
\item[$\bullet$] The distribution of the output of a sieve.
\item[$\bullet$] The contradictory regime that follows from numerical experiment. The attack could not work for some specific choices of parameters, choices that were determined experimentally.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Independance}

The independance heurisic refers to the following problem. Let $W\subset  \Lambda^\vee$ be a family of vectors and $t\in \mathbb R^n$, all of which are sampled from probability distributions. Even if we suppose that all vectors in $W$ are mututally independant, the random variables 
\[\cos (\langle w ,t \rangle) \text{ for }w\in W\]
are not. 

This should in principle invalidate the use of Hoeffding inequality which requires the summands to be independant. But the bound obtained does not depend on the value of $t$, which by a simple conditionning allows us to still obtain the same bound. Indeed, $\cos (\langle w ,t \rangle)$ are independant conditionally to $t$, i.e. for every family of measurable subsets $\{A_w\}_{w\in W}$ of $\mathbb R$, we have
\[ \mathbb P(\cap_{w\in W} \cos (\langle w ,t \rangle) \in A_w | t) =\prod_{w\in W} \mathbb P(\cos (\langle w ,t \rangle) \in A_w | t) .\] 
In \cite{PoulyShen}, the use of Hoeffding inequaltiy ensures that
\[\mathbb P(|g_w(t)-f(t)| > \varepsilon |t) \leq Ce^{-c\varepsilon^2}.\]
Then 
\[\begin{split}
\mathbb P(|g_w(t)-f(t)| > \varepsilon ) & =\int \mathbb P(|g_w(t)-f(t)| > \varepsilon |t = t')\mathbb P_t(dt') \\
		& \leq Ce^{-c\varepsilon^2}\\
\end{split}\]
Thus, we see that $g_w(t)$ concentrated around its mean value $f(t)$, even in the independance heuristic.

\subsection{Output of a sieve}

The distribution of vectors in $W$ also influence the validity of the distinguisher. Indeed, the analysis carried in \cite{pouly2023provable} relies on the assumption that the element of $W$ are sampled independantly from $D_{\Lambda^\vee ,s^{-1}}$. In that case, the distinguisher can be determined via an application of the Poisson summation formula. We have that 
\[f(t) = \mathbb E[g_W(t)|t ] = \frac{\rho_s(\Lambda + t)}{\rho_s(\Lambda)}.\]

In other works (\cite{carrier2024reduction}, \cite{ducas2023accurate}), the output of a sieve is modelled as a uniform distribution on either a euclidean ball or a thick sphere. In these cases, the computation of the distinguisher relies on classical harmonic analysis of radial function, i.e. decomposition of the characteristic function against spherical harmonics, given by Bessel functions.\\

Let us describe more precisely the previous paragraph. Let $B^{(d)}(r)$ be the euclidean ball $\{x\in\mathbb R^d \ : \  \|x\|_2\leq r\}$ and $S^{(d)}(r,\delta)$ be the thick sphere 
\[ B^{(d)}(r+\delta) \backslash B^{(d)}(r-\delta).\] 
Then if $W\sim\mathcal U(B^{(d)}(r))$,
\[\begin{split}
f(t) & = \mathbb E[e^{i\langle W, t\rangle}] \\
	& = \int_{\mathbb R^n} \chi_{B^{(d)}(r)}(x) e^{i\langle x, t\rangle}dx . \\
\end{split}\]
In the case where $\tilde W\sim\mathcal U(S^{(d)}(r,\delta))$, 
\[\begin{split}
\tilde f(t)  & = \mathbb E[e^{i\langle \tilde W, t\rangle}]\\
	& =  \int_{\mathbb R^n} \chi_{B^{(d)}(r+\delta)}(x) e^{i\langle x, t\rangle}dx - \int_{\mathbb R^n} \chi_{B^{(d)}(r-\delta)}(x) e^{i\langle x, t\rangle}dx. \\
\end{split}\]
